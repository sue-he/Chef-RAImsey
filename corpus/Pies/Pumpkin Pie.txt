Pumpkin Pie

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I've ever used. It's been in the family for at least sixty years! Since, in our family, one pie is never enough, I like to triple the filling recipe and divide it into two pie shells, since, as my Mom always says, "No body likes a skimpy pie!"  (Of course, this will add a few minutes to the baking time, too.) Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.

1 ½ cups pumpkin puree
