Cheryl's Lemon Chess Pie

A true Southern favorite, this is a wonderful chess pie with the tart taste of lemon. My great grandmother gave me this recipe and I make it every year for the holidays. This pie must be refrigerated. 

1  refrigerated pie crust (such as Pillsbury®) 
4 extra large eggs 
2 small lemons, juiced 
2 cups white sugar 
½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 
½ cup whole milk 
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
2 tablespoons corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy®) 
¼ teaspoon salt
