Crumb-Top Rhubarb Custard Pie

Once rhubarb season starts, my daughter immediately requests I make this pie. The recipe makes a large 10-inch pie, but is very easy to assemble and always comes out perfect. 

1  unbaked 10-inch pie shell 
2  slightly beaten eggs 
3 cups diced rhubarb 
1 ½ cups white sugar 
½ cup milk 
1 teaspoon cornstarch 
¼ teaspoon nutmeg 
⅛ teaspoon salt 
1 cup all-purpose flour 
½ cup firmly packed brown sugar 
½ cup margarine
