Tar Heel Pie

This pie is best if under-baked and a bit gooey like a brownie inside. This is a very rich pie, so small slices are advised. 

½ cup butter, melted 
¾ cup chocolate chips 
½ cup all-purpose flour 
½ cup brown sugar 
½ cup white sugar 
2  eggs, beaten 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 cup chopped pecans 
½ cup flaked coconut 
¼ cup chocolate chips 
1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust
