Saskatoon (Serviceberry) Rhubarb Pie

This is an amazingly delicious pie that gets its rich red color and juiciness from the rhubarb and delicious Saskatoon berry flavor and depth from the saskatoon berries.  This pie has a flavor that is just to die for. Not bland at all. You will NOT go wrong with this pie.  Everyone begs for more when I bring this pie out.  Enjoy!!
