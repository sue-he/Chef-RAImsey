Strawberry-Rhubarb Buckle

Growing up in Wisconsin, we had a patch of rhubarb growing in our backyard, and I loved all of the delicious desserts my Mom would make when it was in season. This recipe is my spin on her strawberry-rhubarb cake. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of sweetened whipped cream, if desired. 

1 ½ cups diced fresh rhubarb 
1 ½ cups diced fresh strawberries 
½ cup white sugar 
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
3 tablespoons water, divided 
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
  cooking spray 
½ cup butter, softened 
½ cup white sugar 
1  large egg 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
½ cup plain yogurt 
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour 
½ teaspoon baking soda 
½ teaspoon baking powder 
½ teaspoon salt 
3 tablespoons brown sugar 
¼ cup flour 
2 tablespoons butter
