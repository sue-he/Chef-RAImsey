This is a delicious cherry cobbler made with fresh cherries instead of canned. It may take a little longer to make because you need to pit the cherries, but it is well worth it when you taste the finished product. 

½ cup butter 
1 cup all-purpose flour 
1 cup white sugar 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
1 cup milk 
2 cups pitted sour cherries 
¾ cup white sugar
