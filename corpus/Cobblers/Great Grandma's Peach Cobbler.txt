Great Grandma's Peach Cobbler

This was my great grandma's recipe from the 40's and earlier. Its so easy to make. I remember this being my favorite dessert from when I was a child. This is delicious when hot and served with ice cream or I enjoy it cold by itself. Enjoy! 

1 (29 ounce) can sliced peaches in juice, drained, reserving juice 
1 cup self-rising flour 
1 cup white sugar 
1  egg 
Â½ cup butter, melted
