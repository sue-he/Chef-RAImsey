Banana Oatmeal Cookie

This recipe has been handed down in my family for generations. It's a good way to use overripe bananas. It's also a moist cookie that travels well  either in the mail or car. This is usually the first cookie to disappear at my house. 

1 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour 
½ teaspoon baking soda 
1 teaspoon salt 
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg 
¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon 
¾ cup shortening 
1 cup white sugar 
1  egg 
1 cup mashed bananas 
1 ¾ cups quick cooking oats 
½ cup chopped nuts
