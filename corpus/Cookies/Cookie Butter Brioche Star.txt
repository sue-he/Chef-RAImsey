Cookie Butter Brioche Star

Cookie butter is basically the best thing on this planet, and I am always looking for different ways to eat it. I like to use Biscoff® Cookie Butter. It has more of a caramel taste, where as other cookie butters have a more ginger taste. 

3 ⅓ cups bread flour 
⅓ cup white sugar 
2 teaspoons active dry yeast 
1 pinch salt 
¾ cup milk, warmed 
2  eggs, separated 
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed 
1 cup cookie butter (such as Biscoff®), divided
