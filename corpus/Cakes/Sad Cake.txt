Sad Cake

This cake is called sad cake because the cake looks sad. It actually "falls" during baking and is a flat cake.  It may be sad looking, but it is moist, chewy and sweet.  It does not need a frosting. 

2 cups biscuit baking mix 
2 ¼ cups packed brown sugar 
4  eggs 
½ cup vegetable oil 
1 cup flaked coconut 
1 cup chopped pecans 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
