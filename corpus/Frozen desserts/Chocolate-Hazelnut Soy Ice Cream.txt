Chocolate-Hazelnut Soy Ice Cream

I like ice cream, chocolate and hazelnuts. This combination was obvious. This ice cream is great smashed between vegan chocolate chip cookies! 

½ (12 ounce) package extra-firm silken tofu 
1 cup soy milk 
1 tablespoon hazelnut flavored syrup 
4 teaspoons instant espresso powder 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
⅔ cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted
