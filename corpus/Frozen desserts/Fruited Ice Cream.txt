Fruited Ice Cream

First Prize ice cream--feel free to use your favorite fruit in place of the strawberries. This is designed for an old-fashioned ice cream maker that yields 1 gallon; be sure to scale recipe down if you have a countertop model. 

2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk 
5 cups milk 
2 cups heavy cream 
2 tablespoons vanilla extract 
Â½ teaspoon salt 
3 cups chopped strawberries
