Maple Ice Cream

This creamy maple-sweetened ice cream tastes like it came straight from the sugar house. It's a simple custard-style ice cream recipe that just replaces refined sugar with maple syrup for a just-sweet-enough maple-y treat. Feel free to dress it up with mix-ins or toppings or just enjoy it plain. 

1 cup maple syrup, divided 
8  egg yolks 
3 cups half-and-half 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 pinch salt 
1 tablespoon vanilla extract  (Optional)
