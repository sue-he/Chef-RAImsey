Cake Batter Ice Cream

I was in love with this ice cream from a couple of local stores, and I combined a couple of different recipes and came up with this one. 

1 cup milk 
½ cup white sugar 
2  egg yolks, beaten 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
2 cups heavy whipping cream 
¾ cup white cake mix, sifted
