Yemi's Milk Cobbler

This tasty cobbler uses milk and slightly beaten eggs, too! As I let the mixture rest, I cut up two apples, 3 / 4 lb. of

2 tablespoon warmed milk
2  room temperature slightly beaten eggs
3 cup  diced rhubarb
1 and ½ tablespoon warmed milk
1   (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
3 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
2 cup  grated carrots
1 can with juice (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple
¼ tablespoon  baking soda
1 cup chopped mashed bananas
4 tablespoon  shortening
